# Heap
This is a Heap created as an assignment for the course Data Structures II while studying at Webster University

In conjunction with the Heap, this repository also holds customer.h and waitlist.cpp

customer.h is the customer object that is used for the driver function.
waitlist.cpp is the driver function that simulates a priority queue in an airport

Note: Due to a previous hard drive failure and no longer having access to my student account through Webster, I do not have the overbooked.bin file used in the driver program.
